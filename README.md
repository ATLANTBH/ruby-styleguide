## Ruby Styleguide

This is our internal style guide for Ruby which is mostly copied from Github's
style guide. If you have any suggestions please create a pull request with your
changes. Here's what Github wrote about this guide:

> If you're visiting from the internet, feel free to learn from our style. This
is a guide we use for our own ruby apps internally at GitHub. We encourage you
to set up one that works for your own team.

> Much of this was taken from https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide.
Please add to this guide if you find any particular patterns or styles that
we've adopted internally. Submit a pull request to ask for feedback (if you're
an employee).

## Coding Style

* Use soft-tabs with a two space indent
* Keep lines fewer than 80 characters
* Never leave trailing whitespace
* Use spaces around operators, after commas, colons and semicolons, around `{`
   and before `}`

    ```Ruby
    sum = 1 + 2
    a, b = 1, 2
    1 > 2 ? true : false; puts 'Hi'
    [1, 2, 3].each { |e| puts e }

* No spaces after `(`, `[` or before `]`, `)`

    ```Ruby
     some(arg).other
     [1, 2, 3].length
    
* Indent `when` as deep as `case`

     ```Ruby
     case
     when song.name == 'Misty'
       puts 'Not again!'
     when song.duration > 120
       puts 'Too long!'
     when Time.now.hour > 21
       puts "It's too late"
     else
       song.play
     end

     kind = case year
            when 1850..1889 then 'Blues'
            when 1890..1909 then 'Ragtime'
            when 1910..1929 then 'New Orleans Jazz'
            when 1930..1939 then 'Swing'
            when 1940..1950 then 'Bebop'
            else 'Jazz'
            end


* Use empty lines between defs and to break up a method into logical
   paragraphs

    ```Ruby
    def some_method
      data = initialize(options)

      data.manipulate!

      data.result
    end

    def some_method
      result
    end

## Documentation

Use [TomDoc](http://tomdoc.org/) to the best of your ability. It's pretty sweet:

```Ruby
# Public: Duplicate some text an arbitrary number of times.
#
# text  - The String to be duplicated.
# count - The Integer number of times to duplicate the text.
#
# Examples
#
#   multiplex('Tom', 4)
#   # => 'TomTomTomTom'
#
# Returns the duplicated String.
def multiplex(text, count)
  text * count
end
```


# Syntax


* Use `def` with parentheses when there are arguments. Omit the parentheses
   when the method doesn't accept any arguments

    ```Ruby
    def some_method
      # body omitted
     end

    def some_method_with_arguments(arg1, arg2)
      # body omitted
    end

* Never use `for`, unless you know exactly why. Most of the time iterators
   should be used instead. `for` is implemented in terms of `each` (so you're
   adding a level of indirection), but with a twist - `for` doesn't introduce a
   new scope (unlike `each`) and variables defined in its block will be visible
   outside it

    ```Ruby
    arr = [1, 2, 3]

    # bad
    for elem in arr do
      puts elem
    end

    # good
    arr.each { |elem| puts elem }

* Never use `then` for multi-line `if/unless`

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    if some_condition then
      # body omitted
    end

    # good
    if some_condition
        # body omitted
    end

* Avoid the ternary operator except in cases where all expressions are
   extremely trivial. However, do use the ternary operator over
   `if/then/else/end` constructs for single line conditionals

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    result = if some_condition then something else something_else end

    # good
    result = some_condition ? something : something_else

* Use one expression per branch in a ternary operator. This also means that
   ternary operators must not be nested. Prefer `if/else` constructs in these
   cases

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    some_condition ? (nested_condition ? nested_something : nested_something_else) : something_else

    # good
    if some_condition
      nested_condition ? nested_something : nested_something_else
    else
      something_else
    end

* The `and` and `or` keywords are banned. It's just not worth it. Always use
   `&&` and `||` instead

* Avoid multi-line ternary operator, use `if/unless` instead

* Favor modifier `if/unless` usage when you have a single-line body

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    if some_condition
      do_something
    end

    # good
    do_something if some_condition

* Never use `unless` with `else`. Rewrite these with the positive case first

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    unless success?
      puts 'failure'
    else
      puts 'success'
    end

    # good
    if success?
      puts 'success'
    else
      puts 'failure'
    end

* Don't use parentheses around the condition of an `if/unless/while`

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    if (x > 10)
      # body omitted
    end

    # good
    if x > 10
      # body omitted
    end

* Prefer `{...}` over `do...end` for single-line blocks. Avoid using `{...}`
   for multi-line blocks (multiline chaining is always ugly). Always use
   `do...end` for "control flow" and "method definitions" (e.g. in Rakefiles
   and certain DSLs).  Avoid `do...end` when chaining

    ```Ruby
    names = ["Bozhidar", "Steve", "Sarah"]

    # good
    names.each { |name| puts name }

    # bad
    names.each do |name|
      puts name
    end

    # good
    names.select { |name| name.start_with?("S") }.map { |name| name.upcase }

    # bad
    names.select do |name|
      name.start_with?("S")
    end.map { |name| name.upcase }

Some will argue that multiline chaining would look OK with the use of `{...}`, 
but they should ask themselves - is this code really readable and can't the 
block's contents be extracted into nifty methods?

* Avoid `return` where not required

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    def some_method(some_arr)
        return some_arr.size
    end

    # good
    def some_method(some_arr)
        some_arr.size
    end

* Use spaces around the `=` operator when assigning default values to method
   parameters:

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    def some_method(arg1=:default, arg2=nil, arg3=[])
      # do something...
    end

    # good
    def some_method(arg1 = :default, arg2 = nil, arg3 = [])
      # do something...
    end

While several Ruby books suggest the first style, the second is much more 
prominent in practice (and arguably a bit more readable).

* Using the return value of `=` (an assignment) is ok assignment with
   parenthesis

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    if (v = array.grep(/foo/)) ...

    # good
    if v = array.grep(/foo/) ...

    # also good - has correct precedence.
    if (v = next_value) == "hello" ...

* Use `||=` freely to initialize variables

    ```Ruby
    # set name to Bozhidar, only if it's nil or false
    name ||= 'Bozhidar'

* Don't use `||=` to initialize boolean variables (consider what would happen
   if the current value happened to be false)

    ```Ruby
    # bad - would set enabled to true even if it was false
    enabled ||= true

    # good
    enabled = true if enabled.nil?

* Avoid using Perl-style special variables (like `$0-9`, `$`, etc. ). They are
   quite cryptic and their use in anything but one-liner scripts is
   discouraged. Prefer long form versions such as `$PROGRAM_NAME`

* Never put a space between a method name and the opening parenthesis

    ```Ruby
    # bad 
    f (3 + 2) + 1

    # good 
    f(3 + 2) + 1

* If the first argument to a method begins with an open parenthesis, always
   use parentheses in the method invocation. For example, write `f((3 + 2) +
   1)`

* Use `_` for unused block parameters

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    result = hash.map { |k, v| v + 1 }

    # good
    result = hash.map { |_, v| v + 1 }

## Naming

* Use snake\_case for methods and variables
* Use CamelCase for classes and modules (keep acronyms like HTTP, RFC, XML
   uppercase)
* Use SCREAMING\_SNAKE\_CASE for other constants
* The names of predicate methods (methods that return a boolean value) should
   end in a question mark. (i.e. `Array#empty?`)
* The names of potentially "dangerous" methods (i.e. methods that modify
   `self` or the arguments, `exit!`, etc.) should end with an exclamation mark
   Bang methods should only exist if a non-bang method exists  ([more on
   this](http://dablog.rubypal.com/2007/8/15/bang-methods-or-danger-will-rubyist))

## Classes

* Avoid the usage of class (`@@`) variables due to their "nasty" behavior in
   inheritance

    ```Ruby
    class Parent
      @@class_var = 'parent'

      def self.print_class_var
        puts @@class_var
      end
    end

    class Child < Parent
      @@class_var = 'child'
    end

    Parent.print_class_var # => will print "child"

As you can see all the classes in a class hierarchy actually share one class
variable. Class instance variables should usually be preferred over class
variables.

* Use `def self.method` to define singleton methods. This makes the methods
   more resistant to refactoring changes

    ```Ruby
    class TestClass
      # bad
      def TestClass.some_method
        # body omitted
      end

      # good
      def self.some_other_method
        # body omitted
      end

* Avoid `class << self` except when necessary, e.g. single accessors and
   aliased attributes

    ```Ruby
    class TestClass
      # bad
      class << self
        def first_method
          # body omitted
        end

        def second_method_etc
          # body omitted
        end
      end

      # good
      class << self
        attr_accessor :per_page
        alias_method :nwo, :find_by_name_with_owner
      end

      def self.first_method
        # body omitted
      end

      def self.second_method_etc
        # body omitted
      end
    end

* Indent the `public`, `protected`, and `private` methods as much the method
   definitions they apply to. Leave one blank line above them

    ```Ruby
    class SomeClass
      def public_method
        # ...
      end

      private
      def private_method
        # ...
      end
    end

* Avoid explicit use of `self` as the recipient of internal class or instance
   messages unless to specify a method shadowed by a variable

    ```Ruby
    class SomeClass
      attr_accessor :message

      def greeting(name)
        message = "Hi #{name}" # local variable in Ruby, not attribute writer
        self.message = message
      end
    end

## Exceptions

* Don't use exceptions for flow of control

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    begin
      n / d
    rescue ZeroDivisionError
      puts "Cannot divide by 0!"
    end

    # good
    if d.zero?
      puts "Cannot divide by 0!"
    else
      n / d
    end

* Avoid rescuing the `Exception` class

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    begin
      # an exception occurs here
    rescue
      # exception handling
    end

    # still bad
    begin
      # an exception occurs here
    rescue Exception
      # exception handling
    end

## Collections

* Prefer `%w` to the literal array syntax when you need an array of strings

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    STATES = ['draft', 'open', 'closed']

    # good
    STATES = %w(draft open closed)

* Use `Set` instead of `Array` when dealing with unique elements. `Set`
   implements a collection of unordered values with no duplicates. This is a
   hybrid of `Array`'s intuitive inter-operation facilities and `Hash`'s fast
   lookup

* Use symbols instead of strings as hash keys

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    hash = { 'one' => 1, 'two' => 2, 'three' => 3 }

    # good
    hash = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }

## Strings

* Prefer string interpolation instead of string concatenation:

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    email_with_name = user.name + ' <' + user.email + '>'

    # good
    email_with_name = "#{user.name} <#{user.email}>"

* Prefer double-quoted strings. Interpolation and escaped characters will
   always work without a delimiter change, and `'` is a lot more common than
   `"` in string literals

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    name = 'Bozhidar'

    # good
    name = "Bozhidar"

* Avoid using `String#+` when you need to construct large data chunks.
   Instead, use `String#<<`. Concatenation mutates the string instance in-place
   and is always faster than `String#+`, which creates a bunch of new string
   objects

    ```Ruby
    # good and also fast
    html = ''
    html << '<h1>Page title</h1>'

    paragraphs.each do |paragraph|
      html << "<p>#{paragraph}</p>"
    end

## Regular Expressions

* Avoid using `$1-9` as it can be hard to track what they contain. Named groups
   can be used instead

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    /(regexp)/ =~ string
    ...
    process $1

    # good
    /(?<meaningful_var>regexp)/ =~ string
    ...
    process meaningful_var

* Be careful with `^` and `$` as they match start/end of line, not string
   endings. If you want to match the whole string use: `\A` and `\Z`

    ```Ruby
    string = "some injection\nusername"
    string[/^username$/]   # matches
    string[/\Ausername\Z/] # don't match

* Use `x` modifier for complex regexps. This makes them more readable and you
   can add some useful comments. Just be careful as spaces are ignored

    ```Ruby
    regexp = %r{
      start         # some text
      \s            # white space char
      (group)       # first group
      (?:alt1|alt2) # some alternation
      end
    }x

## Percent Literals

* Use `%w` freely

    ```Ruby
    STATES = %w(draft open closed)

* Use `%()` for single-line strings which require both interpolation and
   embedded double-quotes. For multi-line strings, prefer heredocs

    ```Ruby
    # bad (no interpolation needed)
    %(<div class="text">Some text</div>)
    # should be '<div class="text">Some text</div>'

    # bad (no double-quotes)
    %(This is #{quality} style)
    # should be "This is #{quality} style"

    # bad (multiple lines)
    %(<div>\n<span class="big">#{exclamation}</span>\n</div>)
    # should be a heredoc.

    # good (requires interpolation, has quotes, single line)
    %(<tr><td class="name">#{name}</td>)


* Use `%r` only for regular expressions matching more than one '/' character

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    %r(\s+)

    # still bad
    %r(^/(.*)$)
    # should be /^\/(.*)$/

    # good
    %r(^/blog/2011/(.*)$)
